INTRODUCTION.

Qumrus Hosnms Fucens was born on tha eth
of December, in the yem- 65, Β, 0., nt Vennsium, n
town situated between Apulia and Lucania. Although
a freedman, his father possessed competent means, and
left him s comfortable patrimony on the banlm of the
Aufidus

'l'n the edumtion of om· poet the greatest attention
was paid, and no means were spured to endow him
with the highest gifts os mental culture 'l'he severs
Orbilius was his gujde through the reslms of Roman
literature, for the poete οἲ which he seems to have con-
oeived nu early distaste, preferring the more fiuished
and less ruggeri beauties of the Greek originale, from
whose sources he was himself destined hereafter to draw
so largely‚ snd with such distinguished success.

'l'he life of Horace, although spent in the society of
those who were most netively mixed up with publio
affairs, is rather n detail of every-day transactione with
the ordinary world, a table-tull( of private sets and
feelings, thau a suecession of stin-ing political relations,
exploits, und emberrusmsnts.
